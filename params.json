The server accepts HTTP requests and responds with SVG or JSON data. The SignWriting Server is built with the PHP SLIM Framework v2.6.\r\n\r\nThe primary site is available on the Center for Sutton Movement Writing server.\r\n* https://signpuddle.net\r\n\r\nA mirror site is available on Wikimedia Labs.\r\n* https://swserver.wmflabs.org\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### SVG images\r\nThe SignWriting server creates SVG images for individual symbols using symbol keys and completed 2-dimensional signs using Formal SignWriting.  Styling strings are supported, offering coloring and sizing customizations.\r\n* http://swserver.wmflabs.org/svg/S10000\r\n* http://swserver.wmflabs.org/svg/font/S20500\r\n* http://swserver.wmflabs.org/svg/M548x514S11010509x487S11018477x487S2df1e453x489S2df06528x489\r\n* http://swserver.wmflabs.org/svg/M548x514S11010509x487S11018477x487S2df1e453x489S2df06528x489-CP10G_lightblue_D_x,lightblue_Zx\r\n\r\n### Query string transformation to regular expressions\r\nQuery strings are a concise representation of a much larger and detailed set of regular expressions.\r\nEach query string is transformed into one or more regular expressions that can be used to search a text of Formal SignWriting.\r\nAdditionally, Formal SignWriting strings can be converted into several types of query strings, each of which can be transformed into regular expressions.\r\n* http://swserver.wmflabs.org/regex/Q\r\n* http://swserver.wmflabs.org/regex/s/M548x514S11010509x487S11018477x487S2df1e453x489S2df06528x489\r\n\r\n### Countries of the world\r\nThe countries of the world are described with SVG shapes and flag images.\r\nListings of languages and puddle collections are available for each country.\r\n\r\n### Puddle collections and sign entries\r\nAll of the SignPuddle Online data is available as SQLite 3 databases.\r\nThese databases can be downloaded individually.\r\nThe various puddle collections can be listed, limited by sign language or individual code.\r\nFor each sign language, a default public dictionary has been selected so that ISO 639-3 codes can be used rather than a puddle code.\r\nWith a puddle query, individual entries can be access with sign language directly.\r\nWith a puddle search, individual entries can be access with spoken language.\r\nAdditional search options are available for listings of individual signs and terms.\r\nAdditionally, entries can be retrieved by the dates created or updated.\r\n\r\n### License\r\nSignWriting Server  \r\nCopyright (c) 2007-2016, Stephen E Slevinski Jr  \r\nLicensed under the [MIT License][63]  \r\n\r\n- - -\r\n## SignMaker 2015 ##\r\nGithub repo: [signmaker][66], currently version 1.3.2\r\n\r\nSignMaker is a standards based editor, utilizing HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SVG, TrueType Fonts, and PNG images.\r\nWrite signs in any sign language with the SignWriting script using the SignWriting 2010 Fonts.\r\n\r\nSignMaker is browser based without the need for a server connection. It can be used online or it can be [downloaded](https://github.com/Slevinski/signmaker/archive/gh-pages.zip) and run directly from the user's computer.\r\n\r\nThe primary online website can be used to create a private dictionary in the browser's LocalStorage or view dozens of sign language dictionaries from around the world.\r\n - [SignMaker on SignBank](http://signbank.org/signmaker.html)\r\n\r\nThe secondary online website can be used to create a private dictionary in the browser's LocalStorage.\r\n - [SignMaker on GitHub.io](http://slevinski.github.io/signmaker)\r\n\r\n### License\r\nSignMaker  \r\nCopyright (c) 2007-2015, Stephen E Slevinski Jr  \r\nLicensed under the [MIT License][63]  \r\n\r\n- - -\r\n## SignWriting Character Viewer ##\r\nGithub repo: [SignWriting_Character_Viewer][69], v1 and v2.\r\n\r\nThe SignWriting Character Viewer is composed of an HTML file, a CSS file, and 5 JavaScript files.  For convenience, these files have been combined into a single file that is just over 100 KB.\r\n* [SignWriting Character Viewer Index][87]  \r\n \r\nThe SignWriting Character Viewer v1 shows all of the symbols of the International SignWriting Alphabet 2010 using any of the 4 different character encoding forms to access the glyphs of the [SignWriting 2010 Fonts][29].\r\n* [SignWriting Character Viewer v1 as single file][68]  \r\n* [SignWriting Character Viewer v1 as multiple files][67]  \r\n\r\nThe SignWriting Character Viewer v2 shows all of the symbols of the International SignWriting Alphabet 2010 using a plane 4 encoding proposal for Uniocde 10, without Private Use Area characters and without ligatures.  The topic will be discussed at UTC 148 in August 2016.

Newly created fonts are written to the `fonts` directory.\r\n\r\nTo create the demo pages, you need pystache for templating.  Demo pages are written to the `demo` directory.\r\n\r\nTo retrace the SVG from the command line, you will need the following command line tools: Inkscape, pngtopnm, mkbitmap, and potrace.\r\n\r\nTo unpack the SVG Line and SVG Fill data files, the `unpack.py` tool can be used.\r\n\r\n### Tools Directory\r\nTo build individual font files, use the Python script `build.py`.   Use \"-h\" for help\r\n\r\n    cd tools\r\n    python build.py -h\r\n\r\nTo build all of the release font files, use the shell script `release.sh`.\r\n\r\n    cd tools\r\n    chmod a+x release.sh\r\n    ./release.sh\r\n\r\nTo create the demo pages, use the Python script `demo.py`.  Use \"-h\" for help.\r\n\r\n    cd tools\r\n    python demo.py -h\r\n\r\n\r\nTo build the current demo pages used for development, use the shell script `demo.sh`.\r\n\r\n    cd tools\r\n    chmod a+x demo.sh\r\n    ./demo.sh\r\n\r\nSeveral text files are included in the `tools` directory.\r\n\r\n* `symkeys.txt` - list of the 37,811 symbol keys of the ISWA 2010.\r\n* `symsizes.txt` - list of the 37,811 symbol keys with their individual sizes\r\n* `custom.txt` - list of custom settings for the entire font.\r\n* `glyph.txt` - list of glyph settings to apply to each char.\r\n\r\n### Source SVG\r\nThe source SVG files required to build the fonts are available from the [SignWriting 2010 Fonts][29] project.  These files were created with the SignWriting 2010 Tools by retracing the SVG Refinement using the `retrace.py` script.  To use these files, save them to the `source` directory and unzip.\r\n\r\n* [SVG Line][55] \r\n* [SVG Filling][56]\r\n\r\n\r\n- - -\r\n## SignWriting Icon Server ##\r\nGithub repo: [swis][32], currently version 1.3.0\r\n\r\nThe previous generation SignWriting server code for SVG, PNG, and other image formats.

Creating the fonts is a complex process that uses a complex tool.  If anyone is interested in font work collaboration, please contact me. \r\n\r\nThe glyphs of the SignWriting font each have a specific size and shape.  The compatibility of the data between each font-face will depend on the similarity of the glyphs.\r\n\r\n### Sutton SignWriting Font\r\nPlanned for 2016, the Sutton SignWriting Font will replace the [SignWriting 2010 Fonts][29] as the standard font set.  The Sutton SignWriting Font is a two-color font.  The two colors are currently supported with 2 TrueType fonts.  It is possible a single font file could support both colors.\r\n\r\nThe Sutton SignWriting Font will address the issue of symbol distortion for a few symbols.  The Sutton SignWriting Font is a 16-bit font, so it requires an entire Unicode plane in the font itself.  This is currently done on plane 16, but I am hopeful that it can be moved to plane 4.\r\n\r\nThe Sutton SignWriting Font will probably not support the ligatures of Symbol Key, Unicode 8, or PUA Plane 15.  These options will be available in the [SignWriting 2010 Tools][30], but the official distribution will only support direct symbol access and any future Unicode design.\r\n\r\nThe baseline is also an issue.  Currently, the glyphs of the SignWriting 2010 Fonts are written under the baseline.  This design reduces the amount of code that needs to be written, but it hides the glyphs when used in normal contexts.\r\n\r\n### Hamburg SignWriting Font\r\nDuring the SignWriting Symposium of 2015, presentation 51 was about designing an alternate SignWriting Font, called [SignType][77] using typography design ideas.  Valerie Sutton pointed out several issues with the font, but was interested in the effort.  To be able to fully test the font, it must be usable with existing software.  Towards this end, I hope that we will be able to use the [SignWriting 2010 Tools][30] to create a new set of fonts.\r\n\r\nThe fonts will be moderately compatible with the existing data set of Formal SignWriting, but the font may not be perfectly replaceable due to changes in symbols shape and size.\r\n\r\n### Handwritten SignWriting Fonts\r\nThe existing SignWriting fonts are based on SignWriting Block Printing: an international design intended for publishing and computerization.  It should be possible to design a font based on glyphs modeled after a particular style of handwriting.  This would be an involved project with over a thousand hand-crafted glyphs, but automation is possible to create tens of thousands more.\r\n\r\n\r\n- - -\r\n## Epilogue\r\nThis is a work in progress.
