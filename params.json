The fonts have been tailored for the Sutton SignWriting JavaScript Library. Install instructions available for Windows, Linux, Mac, and iOS.  \r\n>Sutton SignWriting Fonts  \r\nCopyright (c) 1974-2016, Center for Sutton Movement Writing, inc  \r\nLicensed under the SIL Open Font License v1.1  \r\n\r\n\r\n### Sutton SignWriting JavaScript Library\r\nThe JavaScript library leverages the TrueType fonts without any additional requirements. \r\nSimply include the Sutton SignWriting JavaScript file in any HTML page to access the functions.  \r\n> Sutton SignWriting JavaScript Library  \r\nCopyright (c) 2007-2016, Stephen E Slevinski Jr  \r\nLicensed under the MIT License  \r\n\r\n- - -\r\n## SignWriting Server ##\r\nGithub repo: [swserver](http://github.com/Slevinski/swserver), currently version 1.3.0\r\n\r\nThe SignWriting Server provides online resources for SignWriting applications and users.  The server accepts HTTP requests and responds with SVG or JSON data. The SignWriting Server is built with the PHP SLIM Framework v2.6.\r\n\r\nThe primary site is available on the Center for Sutton Movement Writing server.\r\n* https://signpuddle.net\r\n\r\nA mirror site is available on Wikimedia Labs.\r\n* https://swserver.wmflabs.org\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### SVG images\r\nThe SignWriting server creates SVG images for individual symbols using symbol keys and completed 2-dimensional signs using Formal SignWriting.  Styling strings are supported, offering coloring and sizing customizations.\r\n* http://swserver.wmflabs.org/svg/S10000\r\n* http://swserver.wmflabs.org/svg/font/S20500\r\n* http://swserver.wmflabs.org/svg/M548x514S11010509x487S11018477x487S2df1e453x489S2df06528x489\r\n* http://swserver.wmflabs.org/svg/M548x514S11010509x487S11018477x487S2df1e453x489S2df06528x489-CP10G_lightblue_D_x,lightblue_Zx\r\n\r\n### Query string transformation to regular expressions\r\nQuery strings are a concise representation of a much larger and detailed set of regular expressions.\r\nEach query string is transformed into one or more regular expressions that can be used to search a text of Formal SignWriting.\r\nAdditionally, Formal SignWriting strings can be converted into several types of query strings, each of which can be transformed into regular expressions.\r\n* http://swserver.wmflabs.org/regex/Q\r\n* http://swserver.wmflabs.org/regex/s/M548x514S11010509x487S11018477x487S2df1e453x489S2df06528x489\r\n\r\n### Countries of the world\r\nThe countries of the world are described with SVG shapes and flag images.\r\nListings of languages and puddle collections are available for each country.\r\n\r\n### Puddle collections and sign entries\r\nAll of the SignPuddle Online data is available as SQLite 3 databases.\r\nThese databases can be downloaded individually.\r\nThe various puddle collections can be listed, limited by sign language or individual code.\r\nFor each sign language, a default public dictionary has been selected so that ISO 639-3 codes can be used rather than a puddle code.\r\nWith a puddle query, individual entries can be access with sign language directly.\r\nWith a puddle search, individual entries can be access with spoken language.\r\nAdditional search options are available for listings of individual signs and terms.\r\nAdditionally, entries can be retrieved by the dates created or updated.\r\n\r\n### License\r\nSignWriting Server  \r\nCopyright (c) 2007-2016, Stephen E Slevinski Jr  \r\nLicensed under the MIT License  \r\n\r\n- - -\r\n## SignMaker 2015 ##\r\nGithub repo: [signmaker](http://github.com/Slevinski/signmaker), currently version 1.3.2\r\n\r\nSignMaker is a standards based editor, utilizing HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SVG, TrueType Fonts, and PNG images.\r\nWrite signs in any sign language with the SignWriting script using the SignWriting 2010 Fonts.\r\n\r\nSignMaker is browser based without the need for a server connection. It can be used online or it can be [downloaded](https://github.com/Slevinski/signmaker/archive/gh-pages.zip) and run directly from the user's computer.\r\n\r\nThe primary online website can be used to create a private dictionary in the browser's LocalStorage or view dozens of sign language dictionaries from around the world.\r\n - [SignMaker on SignBank](http://signbank.org/signmaker.html)\r\n\r\nThe secondary online website can be used to create a private dictionary in the browser's LocalStorage.\r\n - [SignMaker on GitHub.io](http://slevinski.github.io/signmaker)\r\n\r\n### License\r\nSignMaker  \r\nCopyright (c) 2007-2015, Stephen E Slevinski Jr  \r\nLicensed under the MIT License  \r\n\r\n- - -\r\n## SignWriting 2010 Fonts ##\r\nGithub repo: [signwriting\\_2010\\_fonts](https://github.com/Slevinski/signwriting_2010_fonts), currently version 2.0.1\r\n\r\nSignWriting 2010 is a typeface for written sign languages which makes the entire International SignWriting Alphabet 2010 symbol set available in TrueType fonts.\r\n\r\nThe Sutton SignWriting fonts are an updates revision of the SignWriting 2010 fonts which fixes the appearance and size for some of the symbols. The fonts are built with the SignWriting 2010 Tools.

Creating the fonts is a complex process that uses a complex tool.  If anyone is interested in font work collaboration, please contact me. \r\n\r\nThe glyphs of the SignWriting font each have a specific size and shape.  The compatibility of the data between each font-face will depend on the similarity of the glyphs.\r\n\r\n### Hamburg SignWriting Font\r\nDuring the SignWriting Symposium of 2015, presentation 51 was about designing an alternate SignWriting Font, called [SignType](http://www.signwriting.org/symposium/presentation0051.html) using typography design ideas.  Valerie Sutton pointed out several issues with the font, but was interested in the effort.  To be able to fully test the font, it must be usable with existing software.  Towards this end, I hope that we will be able to use the [SignWriting 2010 Tools](https://github.com/Slevinski/signwriting_2010_tools) to create a new set of fonts.\r\n\r\nThe fonts will be moderately compatible with the existing data set of Formal SignWriting, but the font may not be perfectly replaceable due to changes in symbols shape and size.\r\n\r\n### Handwritten SignWriting Fonts\r\nThe existing SignWriting fonts are based on SignWriting Block Printing: an international design intended for publishing and computerization.  It should be possible to design a font based on glyphs modeled after a particular style of handwriting.  This would be an involved project with over a thousand hand-crafted glyphs, but automation is possible to create tens of thousands more.\r\n\r\n\r\n- - -\r\n## SignWriting Character Viewer ##\r\n> Historical project.
